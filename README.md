# MetricTime
An prank app that displays "Metric Time" so you can prank your friends on cross-country road trips or other international vacations.
Based on @2012rcampion's answer to this question: http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/35808/how-to-make-this-base-10-metric-time-concept-work

## How To Use
Once downloaded to your Phone, you may view the current time in both analog metric and digital metric right on the main screen. From there, you can long-press anywhere on screen to access the handy convertion feature so you can convert any time to or from metric.

## Converting Times
Here is a short table of approximate conversion values for reference. There is also a built-in time-convertion feature that can be opened by long-pressing anywhere on the main metric time screen.

Normal Time | Metric Time
------------ | -------------
30 seconds | ~34 metric seconds
1 minute | ~69 metric seconds
5 minutes | ~3 min 47 sec
10 minutes | ~6 min 34 sec
30 minutes | ~20 min 83 sec
1 hour | ~41 min 66 sec
6 hours (1/4 day) | 2 hours 50 min
12 hours (1/2 day) | 5 hours
18 hours (3/4 day) | 7 hours 50 min
24 hours (1 day) | 10 hours

If you would like just the raw time-convertion functionality of this app to bulk-convert any input time to "Metric", please see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/DeveloperACE/edd2c3b68f240022d4a799c1c3f99645). 


###A note on images
The icons found throughout this app were taken from [icons8](www.icons8.com).

The image of the clock in the app icon was pulled from the internet and appeared to be from www.checkmylevel.com although I could not find the image on their site. If you intend to use this for commercial reasons or anything other than individual use, you may want to find/create a new icon with an image that you have permission to use.

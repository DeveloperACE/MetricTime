# MetricTime
An app to display Metric Time for taking trips to countries that use the metric system. Based on @2012rcampion's answer to this question: http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/35808/how-to-make-this-base-10-metric-time-concept-work

##How It Works
Due to the fact that there were many requirements for this "metric time" concept in order to sell this prank to its original victims, not all of them could be met using just one metric time concept. So, Therefore I have integrated two Metric-timekeeping systems into the app. One system is based on [this](http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/a/35810/18155) answer and involves breaking the day into pieces (decidays, centidays .etc). ~~The other one, which is easier to sell/explain, had 100 seconds to the minute, 100 minutes to the hour and 8.64 hours in the day.~~ *not yet implemented*



###Please Note:
The image of the clock in the app icon was pulled from the internet and appeared to be from www.checkmylevel.com although I could not find the image on their site. If you intend to use this for commercial reasons or anything other than individual use, you may want to find/create a new icon with an image that you have permission to use.

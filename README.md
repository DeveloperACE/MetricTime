# MetricTime
An app to display Metric Time for taking trips to countries that use the metric system. Based on @2012rcampion's answer to this question: http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/35808/how-to-make-this-base-10-metric-time-concept-work

##How It Works
For information on the metric time concept behind this app, please see [this](https://github.com/DeveloperACE/MetricTime/wiki/The-MetricTime-Concept) wiki entry.



###Please Note:
The image of the clock in the app icon was pulled from the internet and appeared to be from www.checkmylevel.com although I could not find the image on their site. If you intend to use this for commercial reasons or anything other than individual use, you may want to find/create a new icon with an image that you have permission to use.

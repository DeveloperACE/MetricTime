# MetricTime
An app to display Metric Time for taking trips to countries that use the metric system. Based on @2012rcampion's answer to this question: http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/35808/how-to-make-this-base-10-metric-time-concept-work

## How To Use
Once downloaded to your Phone, you may view the current time in both analog metric and digital metric right on the main screen. From there, you can long-press anywhere on screen to access the handy convertion feature so you can convert any time to or from metric.

## Converting Times
If you would like just the raw time-convertion functionality of this app to bulk-convert any input time to "Metric", please see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/DeveloperACE/edd2c3b68f240022d4a799c1c3f99645). there is also a built-in Metric-time-converter that is opened by long-pressing anywhere on the initial opening screen.


###A note on images
The icons found throughout this app were taken from [icons8](www.icons8.com).

The image of the clock in the app icon was pulled from the internet and appeared to be from www.checkmylevel.com although I could not find the image on their site. If you intend to use this for commercial reasons or anything other than individual use, you may want to find/create a new icon with an image that you have permission to use.

# MetricTime
An app to display Metric Time for taking trips to countries that use the metric system. Based on @2012rcampion's answer to this question: http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/35808/how-to-make-this-base-10-metric-time-concept-work

## Pranking people.
All necessary information about how this app works and how to sell the prank is on the wiki. www.github.com/DeveloperACE/MetricTime/wiki


## Converting Times
If you would like just the raw time-convertion functionality of this app to bulk-convert any input time to "Metric", please see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/DeveloperACE/edd2c3b68f240022d4a799c1c3f99645).


###Please Note:
The image of the clock in the app icon was pulled from the internet and appeared to be from www.checkmylevel.com although I could not find the image on their site. If you intend to use this for commercial reasons or anything other than individual use, you may want to find/create a new icon with an image that you have permission to use.
